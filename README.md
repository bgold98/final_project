Data source: https://baseballhall.org/explorer

How to run: Run code, but make sure the baseball.db doesn't exist each time

My code is basically made of a few functions and one class. The Player class is
a way to store the info from the scraped info. Then the make_players_list
stores all the scraped info into a list of Players. Then there a bunch of functions
that pull data from the data tables and make plotly graphs. Then there is the
code to populate the data tables.

User Guide:
players - lists Hall of Famers that you can get more info on
teams - lists Teams then you can pick a team and players on the team
graphs - 4 graphs to choose from and display
